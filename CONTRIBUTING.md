# Contributing to Mixite 2

If you would like to contribute code you can do so through GitHub by forking the repository and sending a pull request.
When submitting code, please make every effort to follow existing conventions and style in order to keep the code as readable
as possible.

Mixite 2 is coded in Kotlin which [supports multiple runtimes](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/multiplatform.html) (web,
jvm, android etc). Mixite 2 is agnostic so only uses Kotlin common code (which runs equivalently on all targets)
